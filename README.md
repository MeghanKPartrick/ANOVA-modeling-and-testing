<h1>ANOVA Modeling and Testing</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project uses the same data set as projects: 

[Modeling and Testing](https://github.com/MeghanKPartrick/ModelingandTesting) <br />
[Categorical Data and Polynomial Models](https://github.com/MeghanKPartrick/Categorical-Data-and-Polynomial-Methods)

This project begins by employing boxplots and other visualizations to provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset. Following this, one-way and two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) models are constructed and meticulously analyzed using Tukey's Honest Significant Difference (TukeyHSD) methods. Additionally, interaction plots are generated to facilitate a nuanced examination of the formed models.
